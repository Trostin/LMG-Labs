This research project engaged in collecting datasets and implementing a valid model to reach a causal inference. 

In particular using National Longitudinal Study of Youth from 1997 (NLSY97) and onwards. 
I've ran a stational matching program which finds individuals who are extremely alike, think of it as statistical twins.
This model observers that regardless of gender or race achieving higher education levels is associated with higher wages.
